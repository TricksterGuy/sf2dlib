# Batching demo
This demo demonstrates the usage of the new `sf2d_batch` related functions.
Batching is a way to greatly increase performance if you are drawing the same texture in multiple places on screen.  (Think tilemaps)
A good explanation of this technique can be read about at the following [link](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/32910/what-is-the-technical-definition-of-sprite-batching)

The code for this was adapted from a citro3d tutorial which was written by WinterMute.
The demo shows a bunch of balls being drawn at various locations, you can increase or decrease the number of balls using the up or down buttons.
You can also switch between batched drawing and using the `sf2d_draw_texture_part` function to see the differences in performance
In the case of running on citra the performance improvements ranged from a factor of 2x to 30x depending on how many sprites are being rendered. In non-batched drawing the fps quickly degraded as the number of balls increased.
